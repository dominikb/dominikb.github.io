(<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria\">Wikipedia</a>)</p>\n<p>That’s how I’making more out of my New Year’s resolutions than just keeping them empty phrases.</p>\n<h2>My recap of 2018</h2>\n<p>At my current company, we develop a lot of PHP and admittedly I’ve been at most a mediocre PHP programmer when I joined the company back in August 2017. So my main objective at the beginning of 2018 was to become better at writing PHP. As I was mostly writing frontend code, I also tried dipping my toes into designing a little bit. Although I quite quickly realized that this isn’t really my field of expertise and does not bear as much satisfaction as writing code, I’m happy I gave it a shot.</p>\n<h3>Becoming a better developer</h3>\n<p>Throughout the year multiple things happened, that made me a better developer. I started following different blogs, Twitter accounts and became an enthusiastic listener of podcasts. This got me more and more involved in the community, especially around PHP Laravel, so that I can keep up with the latest and greatest things happening out there.</p>\n<p>During last year I also took a few online courses, most notably I got myself an account at Laracasts, which is an invaluable resource for everyone trying to get into PHP development with Laravel.</p>\n<h3>Open Source &#x26; Hacktoberfest</h3>\n<p>For quite some time I’ve wanted to contribute to Open Source projects. Mostly, because I love programming, but also because this is a great way to exercise and help out other members of the community. This year’s <a href=\"https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/\">Hacktoberfest</a> finally got me started.</p>\n<p>I’ve been put off of contributing to Open Source projects, mostly because of there being lots of new things to learn: How do I open a pull request? What are the requirements for contributions? What happens if my pull request does not meet all the acceptance criteria?</p>\n<p>Hacktoberfest was a great way to myself started by picking some easy issues and eventually opening my first pull requests.</p>\n<p>Since then, I’ve made multiple contributions.</p>\n<h3>Reading, reading, reading …</h3>\n<p>Out of the countless articles, blog posts and books I read, Robert C. Martin’s “The Clean Coder” struck out the most and probably is the single best book recommendation for aspiring coders like me.</p>\n<p>Although I’ve not been coding professionally for too long, lots of scenarios and problems described in this book, I’ve been involved in one way or another.</p>\n<p>It gave me some great insights into how to approach topics related to programming that are not code-specific, like communicating with different stakeholders and acting professionally.</p>\n<p>The most valuable lesson though was, that I learned about the advantages of tests and got to experience the joy of Test Driven Development, which I’ve been a fan of ever since.</p>\n<h3>Personal</h3>\n<p>The most impactful change I’ve taken from a non-professional point of view happened back in September with me picking up going to school again.</p>\n<p>This year I’ve decided that I want to improve my skills by enrolling at <a href=\"https://www.fh-ooe.at/en/hagenberg-campus/\">FH Hagenberg</a> and studying Software Engineering. As I dropped out of school without finishing my A-Level exams, I decided to gain my qualification by attending evening school for two semesters.</p>\n<p>Although going to school 3 to 4 evenings a week while working full time does take up a lot of my time, I’m still enthusiastic about it and I’m looking forward to starting my studies in October.</p>\n<p>My goals in 2019</p>\n<p>I’ve set myself some ambitious goals for the upcoming year.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Blog more: I want to write at least 12 blog posts and redo my personal site (<a href=\"https://dominikb.io/\">https://dominikb.io/</a>) to include a section for blogging</li>\n<li>More Open Source: Double my contributions from last year and best case start maintaining an open source project</li>\n<li>Give a talk at a local meetup group</li>\n<li>Use more keyboard shortcuts: IntelliJ makes this easy with the help of <a href=\"https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/9792-key-promoter-x\">Key Promoter X</a>, an excellent tool that keeps track of your mouse clicks</li>\n<li>Waste less time, become more efficient: This one is probably not as easily measurable as my other goals, but I still feel like it should be on this list.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Recommendations</h2>\n<h3>Podcasts</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.fullstackradio.com/\">http://www.fullstackradio.com/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://syntax.fm/\">https://syntax.fm/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/\">https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://darknetdiaries.com/\">https://darknetdiaries.com/</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Books</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Microservices-Patterns</li>\n<li>The Clean Coder — Robert C.
